# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we are instucted to create a specific line graph that depicts ride share fare in three different types of cities. We describe city types as Rural, Suburban, and Urban. In this challenge, we analyzed ride counts as well as averages of fares per ride, and average drivers all classified and mapped by the city category they fell under. We then took te average fare per ride as well as the average fare per driver and the totals of all rides, drivers, and fares to build and DataFrame and summary graph from the two ride share data packages. 
##Reults 
By creating a Dataframe we are able to see trends in the Data that help us answer our challenge.
