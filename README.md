# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we are instucted to create a specific line graph that depicts ride share fare in three different types of cities. We describe city types as Rural, Suburban, and Urban. In this challenge, we analyzed ride counts as well as averages of fares per ride, and average drivers all classified and mapped by the city category they fell under. We then took te average fare per ride as well as the average fare per driver and the totals of all rides, drivers, and fares to build and DataFrame and summary graph from the two ride share data packages. 
## Reults 
By creating a Dataframe we are able to see trends in the Data that help us answer our challenge.
When observing the DateFrame we can see that population of the city directly affects the number of rides. That then then affects the averages of fares per drivers and rides as well as the totals. Urban cities with the higher density in population sees the highest number of total rides which in-turn raises totals in fares and drivers as well. How ever while urban drivers hold the crown for most earned, we can see that the more drivers there are, the less you average per ride in terms of fares. This entails that the urban drivers make the most amount of fares compared to the suburban and rural drivers. PyBer lets us see that the average fares in rural  areas are the highest, but they make the least amount of money of the three sets of drivers in thier respective cities. This can be attributed to their drive totals enwhich they drive the least amount compared to suburban and urban drivers.

## Sumary	
Below is the multiple line graph showing the monthly data of ride share service fares in each of three catagories of cites. As you can see there are similar and different trends between the three city types through oout these few months. Starting in late January, the suburban population sees a decrease in services and fares while rural and urban communities see an increase. Late Febuary can be seen showing increases in ride share fares from each of the city types. March is a very intersing month because there are subtile increases for the suburban community in the overall month, the Rural population sees a bigger increase in fares and services, and the urban population sees little to no increase. And finnaly the suburban population has a final jump of fares and services while rural and urban communites tail off towards the end of the month.
