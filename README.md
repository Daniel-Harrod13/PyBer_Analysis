# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we are instucted to create a specific line graph that depicts ride share fare in three different types of cities. We describe city types as Rural, Suburban, and Urban. In this challenge, we analyzed ride counts as well as averages of fares per ride, and average drivers all classified and mapped by the city category they fell under. We then took te average fare per ride as well as the average fare per driver and the totals of all rides, drivers, and fares to build and DataFrame and summary graph from the two ride share data packages. 
## Reults 
By creating a Dataframe we are able to see trends in the Data that help us answer our challenge.
When observing the DateFrame we can see that population of the city directly affects the number of rides. That then then affects the averages of fares per drivers and rides as well as the totals. Urban cities with the higher density in population sees the highest number of total rides which in-turn raises totals in fars and drivers as well. How ever while urban drivers hold the crown for most earned, we can see that the more you drive, the more you average per ride in terms of fares goes down. This entails that the urban drivers make the most amount of fares compared to the suburban and rural drivers. We can see that the average fares in rural  areas are the highest, but they make the least amount of money of the three sets of drivers in theier respective cities. This can be attributed to their drive totals enwhich they drive the least amount compared to suburban and urban drivers.
